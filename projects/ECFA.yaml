Description: "Simulate hundreds of millions of high-energy\nproton proton collisions,
  which mimic the\ncollisions expected at the LHC in the coming\nyears.  This simulated
  data is used to assess the\nphysics potential of potential detector upgrades,\n
  allowing decision makers and funding agencies to\nplan for the future."
