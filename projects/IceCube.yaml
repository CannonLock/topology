Description: "IceCube is the world's largest neutrino detector. It is located at the
  South Pole and  includes a cubic kilometer\nof instrumented ice.  IceCube searches
  for neutrinos from the most violent astrophysical sources: events like exploding
  stars, gamma\nray bursts, and cataclysmic phenomena involving black holes and neutron
  stars. The IceCube telescope is a powerful tool to search for\ndark matter, and
  could reveal the new physical processes associated with the enigmatic origin of
  the highest energy particles in\nnature. In addition, exploring the background of
  neutrinos produced in the atmosphere, IceCube studies the neutrinos themselves;
  their\nenergies far exceed those produced by accelerator beams."
