Description: The influence of directing agents in the self-assembly of molecular wires
  to produce two-dimensional electronic nanoarchitectures is studied here using a
  Monte Carlo approach to simulate the effect of arbitrarily locating nodal points
  on a surface, from which the growth of self-assembled molecular wires can be nucleated.
