Description: Program uses NCBI’s Entrez.efetch on the nucleotide database to take
  in large number of sequences and searches the sequences for palindromes ranging
  in size from 4 to 20 and appends the results to a list. The program then takes each
  palindrome and checks for its occurrence on the 11 genes of the influenza A virus’s
  and outputs every match of the palindrome with relevant sequence Information.
