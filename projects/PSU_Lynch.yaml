Description: "OpenSimRoot is an open-source, 3D functional\u2013structural plant model\
  \ that simulates root system architecture 3 dimensionally, accounting for interactions\
  \ between soil physical properties, root growth and associated metabolic costs thus\
  \ enabling study of the value of root traits for resource acquisition and plant\
  \ growth. As a research tool it supports experimental designs and mechanistic understanding\
  \ of underlying processes. We aim to understand plant\u2013soil interactions in\
  \ a wide range of soil taxa, especially with respect to degraded soils in developing\
  \ countries, in order to address the knowledge gap that is critical for global food\
  \ security. https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/labs/roots/methods/computer-analysis-tools\
