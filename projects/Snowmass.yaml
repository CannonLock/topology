Description: "Simulate hundreds of millions of high-energy\nproton proton collisions,
  which mimic the\ncollisions expected at future hadron colliders.\nThis simulated
  data is used to assess the physics\npotential of future colliders, allowing US\n
  decision makers and funding agencies to prioritize\nfuture physics projects."
