Description: "Earthquake Engineering is moving towards performance based\nengineering.
  Performance based engineering will potentially\nrequire and exponentially increase
  the amount of computation\nrequired of engineers as engineers move to incorporate
  risk and\nuncertainty associated with hazard, modeling, cost, material,\netc. into
  the simulations. Currently those in research mostly are\nusing the OpenSees (http://opensees.berkeley.edu)
  application to\nperform these calculations. This project aims at providing these\n
  researchers with access to current versions of OpenSees by\nutilizing resources
  to build the application on OSG resources."
