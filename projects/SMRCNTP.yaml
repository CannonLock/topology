Description: 'We are exploring the free energy landscape of stacking and
columnar liquid assembly in condensed phases of monomer nucleic acids such as
ATP and TTP using enhanced sampling methods. We are validating our methods by
direct comparison with recent experimental studies of these materials. This work
is of relevance to the prebiotic appearance of information carrying polymers
such as DNA and RNA.'
