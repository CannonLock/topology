Description: "We are developing a implementation of a Monte Carlo volume rendering
  method. The primary purpose is to impro\nve the calculation of multiple scattering
  physics, with possible applications in computer graphics, nuclear physics, and remote
  s\nensing. The project involves the numerical calculation of a Feynman path integral,
  which is what most of the computation is devot\ned to, and the primary need for
  high throughput computing methods."
