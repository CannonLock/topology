Description: "To give you a brief idea, I am trying to identify the information flow\n
  among several brain regions in rats in the neuronal level. The rats\nwere actively
  doing a aperture discrimination task (whether a gate\nopened wide or narrow).  I
  wish to find not only the static neuronal\ncircuitry of the sensory input, but also
  the dynamics of the flow\nacross time."
