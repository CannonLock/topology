Description: "The work proposed is Monte Carlo modeling of the interaction between
  mobile and sta-\ntionary phases as they relate to supercritical fluid chromatography
  (SFC). Proposed research\ncontinues that done with the startup allocation, which
  involved writing, testing, and porting\nMonte Carlo code to model intermolecular
  interactions and fluid phase equilibria in com-\npressed carbon dioxide. Carbon
  dioxide is the main component of the mobile phase in SFC,\nwhich typically operates
  at temperatures and and pressures above the critical point. The\nobjective of the
  proposed work is an understanding at the molecular level of the interac-\ntion between
  mobile-phase molecules and the alkylsilane-coated silica stationary phase. The\n
  computational method is Monte Carlo simulation, mainly in the constant-pressure
  Gibbs\nensemble. Hybrid molecular dynamics moves will be used for alklylsilane chains.
  Proposed\ncalculations will survey four alkylsilane coatings, eight pressures, three
  temperatures, and\nthree mobile-phase compositions. Compositions will be pure carbon
  dioxide and carbon\ndioxide modified with 5% or 10% methanol. XSEDE resources requested
  are service units\non the Open Science Grid, which suits the small portable nature
  of the Monte Carlo code.\nWeeks-long runs will be achieved by automatic resubmission
  of jobs."
