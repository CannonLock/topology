Description: This project attempts to find novel geometric symmetries
  in the folding of polygons. It has already produced several interesting
  solutions, and I have now refactored it to be generalizable and
  linearly scalable in an HTC workflow. A small version of it
  serves as an example for HTC parallelization in our workshops.
