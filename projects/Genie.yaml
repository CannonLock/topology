Description: Generates Events for Neutrino Interaction Experiments(GENIE) is a universal
  object-oriented neutrino MC generator supported and developed by an international
  collaboration of scientists whose expertise covers a very broad range of neutrino
  physics aspects, both phenomenological and experimental. GENIE is currently being
  used by T2K, NOvA, MINERvA, MicroBooNE, ArgoNEUT, LAGUNA-LBNO, LBNE, INO, IceCUBE,
  NESSiE and others.
