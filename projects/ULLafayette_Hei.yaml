  While fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions
  has emerged as a pivotal paradigm, enabling promising applications such as ChatGPT
  and GitHub Copilot, the capability to follow arbitrary instructions also introduces
  acute vulnerabilities. This project aims to deepen understanding of the security
  and privacy risks associated with large instruction-tuned language models and to
  obtain insights on how to mitigate these risks.
