Description: >
  Investigating the ability of neural networks to represent functions in the context of approximation theory.
  We seek to uncover areas of scientific computing in which neural networks provide a 'better-than-nothing' 
  approximation of a solution in high-dimensional problems wherein classical scientific computing methods fail. 
  The primary area of investigation is the ability of a neural network to capture inherent low-dimensional 
  structure present in high-dimensional functions.
